For my elevator, I went to Holden Hall on campus and used their elevator #2. I saw no major problems with the elevator's design, but its functionality was odd. For example, when I attempted to go to the 3rd floor, the elevator froze and did not do anything. This happens because there is no 3rd floor in Holden Hall. So the 3rd floor button was essentially useless. The rest of the floor buttons worked fine, including other functionalities such as opening and closing the door. The color design was grey and black, which provided a good contrast between symbols and buttons. The position of the buttons with regards to its symbols were also easy to understand. 

Overall, the elevator is a well-designed one, albeit with one major flaw. Here is the control interface shown below.

The control interface in operation, going to the first floor from the second:

The most common uses for an elevator are to go to a selected floor and to open and close the door. More rare uses include (in the case of the Holden elevator) using the alarm or to call someone for help. For elevator technicians, they have additional access to elevator controls as seen with the several keyholes located on the elevator panel. The current elevator interface makes it easy for people to go to a selected floor.

The most common sequence of actions most users will do are:
1. Enter the elevator
2. Select which floor they would like to go, by pressing the button next to the floor name.
3. The button turns on and has a red highlight around it, indicating the button has been pressed.
4. The user waits in the elevator until the door opens to their floor.
5. User exits the elevator.

The user can figure out how to control the elevator by pressing the button next to the floor number, as mentioned in step 2 above. If a user needs access other functionalities, they can read the text next to each button, which gives an obvious answer as to what it does. The elevator gives user feedback by highlighting the selected button with a red glow, as seen in the control interface gif. Also, when the elevator moves between floors, a small beep sound is given to let users know that the elevator is moving to the selected floor. The elevator interface also supports visually impaired persons by having braille written below each number.

Again, the only mistake I could find in the elevator design is that the 3rd floor button has no functionality. Everytime I pressed it, there would be no user feedback. For some new users, if they are not familiar with the fact that Holden Hall has 2 floors only, they could become confused if they press the 3rd floor button. If I could improve the elevator interface, I would take out the 3rd floor button. I would also introduce another sound to be played right after a user presses a button to let them know that the elevator recognizes their command, along with some other changes. Here is my sketch of the redesigned Holden elevator:

I gave the controls a slightly more colorful design so it looks more pleasing to the users. The alarm and call buttons have been changed to a different color so the user knows that those functions are for special uses only. On the original interface, the "call recieved" indicator was hard to read, so I moved it up next to the 2nd floor button. That should make the button easier for users to see that their button press is recognized. Everything else in the elevator is mostly the same. I believe my interface is more simple and user-friendly than the original one.
